# tests

This directory holds the test suites (unit and integration) for Gid's backend:

- Validate the stability and correctness of the RAG pipeline and backend logic.
- Ensure integrations with Twilio, Vertex AI, and Firestore remain stable.
- Provide early detection of regressions as new features are introduced.

Use your preferred testing framework (e.g., pytest) to run tests and maintain backend quality.
